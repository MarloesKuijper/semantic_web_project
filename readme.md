# Semantic Web Project

# TO DO
1. in functie get_missing_quadruples stel een minimaal aantal 'occurrences' van tuple vertaling dus > ("de", "NAME") minimaal 3 keer ofzo VOOR DE OFFICIELE DATA ALLEEN!
2. get multiling dict from all mappingbased literals data (or part of it) and get new quadruples based on this dict (mee bezig)
3. Count number of new quadruples 
4. Analyse evaluation data
5. Write report
6. Prepare presentation



NOTE: in the repo the shorter files are included (literals_nl_short literals_de_short literals_nl_excerpt literals_de_excerpt), use these to test the system, the other files 
which are too big to be included in the repo, are only for running complete working system (takes way too long otherwise)
the files the shorter ones are based on are: mappingbased_literals_de.tql mappingbased_literals_nl.tql from a dump dating from October 2016
there are also mappingbased_objects_nl (and de) which we can also use
NOTE2: we already have pickle files for literals short and literals excerpt, use these to load the multilingual dictionary (faster)
